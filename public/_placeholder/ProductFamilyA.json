  "CategorySummary": "Broadcom offers a broad selection of rf and microwave amplifiers including Power Amplifiers (PAs), Gain Blocks/Drivers, Low Noise Amplifiers (LNAs) and variable gain amplifiers (VGAs) for cellular applications and diverse markets such as wireless infrastructure, WiMAX, WLAN, test & measurement and other wireless microwave applications. Broadcom is leveraging its experience in handsets and base stations to offer new wireless products targeted at small cell base stations, macrocell base stations, and portable GPS/GNSS systems.Power amplifiers in the MGA-43x28 series are ideal as a final stage PA for Picocell and Enterprise Femtocell systems with a PCB footprint 50% smaller than comparable devices. The MGA-43428, 43528, and 43628 target 3GPP bands 5, 2, and 1, respectively. The MGA-16x16 series of balanced ultra-low-noise amplifiers are designed for cellular infrastructure applications with industry-standard performance and twice the linearity of competing devices. The MGA-16116, 16216, and 16316 target the 450-1450 MHz, the 1440-2350 MHz, and the 1950-2700 MHz frequency bands, respectively.",
