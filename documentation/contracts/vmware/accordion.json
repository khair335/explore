The guidelines below will help you create your banner, should one be warranted and approved.</p><h5 dir=\"ltr\">When to use hero imagery&nbsp;&nbsp;</h5><p dir=\"ltr\">Use it on marketing-oriented pages, i.e. products, solutions and campaign (/info) pages:&nbsp;</p><ul dir=\"ltr\"><li role=\"presentation\">Use clear messaging and/or positioning&nbsp;</li><li role=\"presentation\">Employ a clear call-to-action for the message box&nbsp;</li></ul><h5 dir=\"ltr\">When not to&nbsp;&nbsp;</h5><p dir=\"ltr\">Do not use it on support or other utility pages:</p><ul dir=\"ltr\"><li role=\"presentation\">Support&nbsp;users are intensely mission oriented and do not appreciate the distraction of marketing messages&nbsp;</li><li role=\"presentation\">They are looking for something to fix their problem now, not to engage with the buyer's journey</li><li role=\"presentation\">Adding hero imagery pushes key content further down a page, increasing the friction&nbsp;a user experiences when looking for the information they need&nbsp;</li></ul><h5 dir=\"ltr\">Creating your hero banner</h5><p dir=\"ltr\">The message box:</p><ul dir=\"ltr\"><li role=\"presentation\">Should have a message and should not repeat the title&nbsp;of the page, or be considered the title of the page or product name.</li><li role=\"presentation\">Does not require a secondary line (subtitle). If used, the subtitle should support the title.</li><li role=\"presentation\">The message box title should be 30-60 characters. Correct for widows.</li><li role=\"presentation\">The subtitle should be 55-125 characters but depends on the length of the main title (a longer title leaves less room for a long subtitle). Watch for widowed text.</li><li role=\"presentation\">A call-to-action is recommended. If you are going to push key content down the page with your hero, at least provide&nbsp;the most important call-to-action in the message box.</li><li role=\"presentation\">Broadcom best practice is for one CTA in the hero banner.&nbsp; Make it easy for the user to figure out what you want them to do; what is the most important CTA on the page?&nbsp;</li></ul><h5>Obtaining art for your&nbsp;banner</h5><ul dir=\"ltr\"><li><a href=\"https://imagelibrary.broadcom.com/cloud/\" target=\"_blank\">Broadcom Image Library</a> (via Okta): All employees can use licensed stock images or icons for business-related projects.</li><li role=\"presentation\"><a href=\"http://123rf.com/\" target=\"_blank\">123rf.com</a>: If you do not find any suitable image in our Image Library, you can browse our authorized image vendor 123rf.com for more options and send the image ID and link to brand-list@broadcom.com.&nbsp; We will work with you to determine if it can be purchased and used and added to our library.</li><li role=\"presentation\">Creative Services: If you need a custom banner, submit a job request via Okta &gt; <a href=\"https://imagelibrary.broadcom.com/bp/#/\" target=\"_blank\">Creative Services</a>.

AP also uses&nbsp;<em>hyphens</em>&nbsp;for ranges, such as&nbsp;<em>Jan. 1-4</em>. There should be no spaces surrounding a hyphen.</span></p><p><span>AP does not use&nbsp;<em>en dashes, </em>though you will frequently see it come in with copy. It is about half the width of an&nbsp;<em>em dash</em>, approximating the width of a capital letter&nbsp;<em>N</em>. These should be edited into either hyphens or em dashes according to context. Use your judgment.</span></p><p><span>AP refers to <em>em dashes</em> simply as&nbsp;<em>dashes.</em>&nbsp;They are used to signal abrupt change; as one option to set off a series within a phrase; before attribution to an author or composer in some formats; after datelines; and to start lists.&nbsp;<strong>AP style calls for a space on both sides of a&nbsp;dash&nbsp;in all uses. </strong>An&nbsp;<em>em dash</em>&nbsp;is approximately the width of a capital letter&nbsp;<em>M.</em></span></p><h5><span>commas in a simple series</span></h5><p><span>Use commas to separate elements in a series, but do not put a (serial or Oxford) comma before the conjunction in most simple series:&nbsp;<em>His grandchildren are Vera, Chuck and Dave. He would nominate Marquez, Bedi, Lyman or Wong. She goes to school, plays league soccer and takes private dance lessons.</em></span></p><p><span></span></p>"
